Parking Lot:

As a client, I want a system that calculates total revenue generated by the parking lot within given particular month. For more clarification, size of vehicles accepted are motorbike, small, medium and large sized vehicles. There is a monthly pass system, where it costs 30, 40, 50 and 60 dollars respectively for motorbike, small, medium and large vehicles. Based on hourly system, they are charged respectively with 3, 4, 5 and 6 dollars per hour.
